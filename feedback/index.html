            <q>Best Teacher I have ever had</q>
            <address>Simon from Butte, MT on 1/20/2022</address>
            <blockquote>Ian is an incredibly skilled programming tutor. Over the course of 4 months, he was able to take me from never having written a line of code to building full-scale games using <em>Javascript</em>. He is extremely intuitive and able to convey complex concepts in a simple and straightforward manner. Without Ian's instruction, I never would have reached the level I am at today. As I progressed in my coding journey to learn more complex languages and write more complex programs I continually reference the mental models he helped me build. I will be forever grateful!</blockquote>

            <address>Laura from Redondo Beach, CA on 4/26/2021</address>
            <blockquote>Ian has been a wonderful tutor! He is skilled at explaining <em>Javascript</em> concepts in very relatable terms. We were able to cover higher-order functions, Closures, &ldquo;this&rdquo;, JS Objects, <em>REST APIs</em> and much more in our three lessons together. I look forward to working with him in the future when I get stuck!</blockquote>

            <address>Mike from Chicago, IL on 10/8/2017</address>
            <blockquote>Just had my first hour session with Ian. Out of the six or seven tutors I've booked through Wyzant to teach me <em>JavaScript</em>, Ian was the best. Every tutor I've had knew their stuff, but JS expertise and being able to articulate and transmit concepts are entirely different skill sets. Ian has both. Already booked him for two more hours.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Ian is clearly experienced in internet <em>application development</em>. We covered DOM and JavaScript. Honestly Ian has taught me JavaScript better than some of my undergrad professors. Ian provided solid tips and tricks for handling functions and logic within JavaScript. Would definitely recommend Ian to anyone wanting to learn how to make a websites come to life.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Ian is very knowledgable in both <em>front and back end development</em>, and was extremely thorough in going through everything I needed to work on. He helped explain things as he was going, and didn't mind answering any questions I had. Would definitely recommend if you need help with front or back end, specifically if you are designing something gaming-related.</blockquote>

            <address>Brent from Dallas, TX on 4/10/2023</address>

            <q>Experienced tutor who can really simplify difficult concepts!</q>
            <address>Fariha from Bellerose, NY on 10/15/2016</address>
            <blockquote>I recently got accepted into General Assembly's Web Development <em>immersive course</em>. Although I have some previous experience with HTML and CSS, I have no experience with Javascript whatsoever. Trying to understand Javascript on my own was like reading in a foreign language that I don't know, which it basically is, and that drove me crazy. I was honestly panicking prior to having a session with Ian. Ian took difficult concepts and explained them in a way that resonated with me and made me understand them in simpler terms. One thing he taught me that REALLY resonated with me is using comments when you're writing out your code. It helps you remember what each segment of code's function is so that as you're coding you won't get lost or forget what each segment of code does. Definitely looking forward to working with him again!</blockquote>

            <address>Steven from Vineland, NJ on 2/18/2018</address>
            <blockquote>I have been wanting to learn <em>game development</em> for quite a while. Ian helped point me in the right direction while considering my skill sets and goals. He was able to jump right in with appropriate material that was both on level and refreshed my skills while introducing a few new concepts. We were able to develop appropriate homework for me to study what we went over and to progress to the next level.</blockquote>

            <address>Sam from New York, NY on 6/30/2018</address>
            <blockquote>There was not one question Ian couldn’t answer! Super knowledgeable, patient, and didn’t even mind that I was totally directionless and unprepared.</blockquote>

            <q>Fantastic</q>
            <address>Xander from Woodside, NY on 4/20/2020</address>
            <blockquote>Aside from having a great bedside manner (funny, patient, etc...), Ian's real skill seems to be helping people learn HOW to think. I think a lot of online courses just teach you what to do, but not why (or in Ian's words &ldquo;WHEN&rdquo;) to do it. Def will be hitting him up again.</blockquote>

            <q>A natural born teacher!</q>
            <address>DeAnne from Lakeland, FL on 8/29/2019</address>
            <blockquote>Ian is passionate about programming and knows his stuff. He happily assisted me with my <em>JavaScript</em> homework, when the actual class tutor was of no help. Ian's love of JavaScript really comes through and he was able to show me the most concise method to program form validations.</blockquote>

            <address>James from Los Angeles, CA on 6/22/2017</address>
            <blockquote>I spent some time contacting various tutors with JavaScript expertise. I had a list of projects that many people did not feel comfortable creating or pursuing with me. When I contacted Ian he was prompt in his response and confident in his abilities. I proceeded with my first lesson on 06/15/2017. I could not have been happier. Ian displayed significant in depth knowledge of JavaScript and did a fantastic job explaining 'this', objects and prototypes, along with helping me find a solution to displaying a winner for tic tac toe. I have subscriptions to pluralsight, lynda, several udemy courses and various books on the topic. Ians explanation surpassed all of my previous online teachers and courses within 60 minutes. I now have a much better understanding on <em>object oriented programming</em> and more of the tricky concepts JavaScript has to offer. I will be using Ian as my JavaScript tutor from now on. He was responsive, very knowledgeable, professional, and extremely easy to communicate with. Thanks Ian! I appreciate your help in JavaScript. Looking forward to our future lessons!</blockquote>

            <address>Anthony from Palm Desert, CA on 8/27/2021</address>
            <blockquote>I needed some help working through some tricky and tough JavaScript challenge problems. Ian was patient with me as I tried to figure out each step but he also offered guidance along the way. He was just the boost I needed to complete the final parts of my assignment. He also helped me with a few other <em>JavaScript/HTML</em> problems where we broke down the steps to complete them, as well as what to avoid. Highly recommend!</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Ian’s teaching style is fantastic...a true educator, that can identify what you need to work on before continuing to the next step or lesson... he will ensure that you are retaining information and will work with you until he feels you are grasping the concepts, but nevertheless he will challenge you to work hard</blockquote>

We kept at this until not only did this click for me but several other things fell into place. This may seem mild in comparison to other problems that are usually aided with a tutor but this meant so much to me. Understanding something helps you to remember it. Thank you very much Ian.

I am currently halfway through a <em>FullStack</em> Web-Development Program and while my grade is not an issue, staying ahead is vital and I felt my understanding Javascript was behind. His method and style is both very humble and thorough. He offers context and honest opinions on best practices, good habits, syntax and more and is happy to explain/move at your pace. I am a slow learner and Javascript has been daunting, but I'm slow but surely getting the hang of it through more exposure.

            <blockquote>I am already looking forward to my second session with Ian. He is an awesome tutor. After having me write out my code, I was able to see what I had done. I was able to explain to him what happened. With minor correction as needed. He too reiterated the lines of code he directed me to type out. If you are a visual learner like me, and need to do things yourself to see and understand what happened/how it worked. Then this is the best tutor and site for you. He was very patient as I typed and asked if I wasn't sure what was to come next. That was also kind and great of him.</blockquote>

Ian asked me the right questions to help me think about what I had to do and how, and made sure I understood.
